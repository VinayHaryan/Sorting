Tree Sort

Tree sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Binary Search Tree data structure. 
It first creates a binary search tree from the elements of the input list or array 
and then performs an in-order traversal on the created binary search tree to get the elements in sorted order. 

Algorithm: 
 

Step 1: Take the elements input in an array.
Step 2: Create a Binary search tree by inserting data items from the array into the
        binary search tree.
Step 3: Perform in-order traversal on the tree to get the elements in sorted order.
